This wargame doesn't require any knowledge about programming - just a bit of common
sense and some knowledge about basic unix commands. We had no idea that it'd be this
hard to make an interesting wargame that wouldn't require programming abilities from 
the players. Hopefully we made an interesting challenge for the new ones.
